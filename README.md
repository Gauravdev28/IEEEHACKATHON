I was responsible for planning the event structure and translating it into a fully functional, responsive website that provided participants with clear access to event details, timelines, guidelines, registration, and submission instructions. The project reflects my ability to combine leadership with technical execution, structure information effectively, and deliver a complete solution under strict deadlines while maintaining a clean, user-friendly design.
